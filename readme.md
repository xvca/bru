# Bru - Coffee Scale Interface

A Next.js web application that interfaces with AutoBru, an ESP32-based system that connects to BOOKOO Bluetooth scales and Breville Dual Boiler espresso machines. Designed for coffee brewing with real-time weight, flow rate, and timing measurements.

## Features

- Real-time monitoring via WebSocket
  - Weight measurements with 0.1g precision from BOOKOO scale
  - Flow rate calculations
  - Brew state tracking (Pre-infusion, Brewing, Dripping)
  - Timer functionality
- Automated brewing control
  - Target weight setting with visual progress indicator
  - Remote start/stop capability
- Settings management
  - Device enable/disable toggle
  - Weight-triggered pre-infusion mode
  - Configurable weight presets
  - Shot data management
- Dark/Light theme support
- Progressive Web App (PWA) capabilities
- Persistent preferences storage

## Note

This is the frontend component only. Requires the AutoBru ESP32 firmware to function. The ESP32 firmware component of this project can be found in the [Autobru repository](https://github.com/xvca/autobru). AutoBru provides the hardware interface between your BOOKOO scale, Breville Dual Boiler, and this web interface.

This project is in active development and plans to evolve into a comprehensive coffee brewing platform, featuring brew history tracking, coffee bean inventory management, and detailed brew analytics.
