## Note

This is the frontend component only. Requires the AutoBru ESP32 firmware to function. The ESP32 firmware component of this project can be found in the [Autobru repository](https://github.com/xvca/autobru).

This project is in active development and plans to evolve into a comprehensive coffee brewing platform, featuring brew history tracking, coffee bean inventory management, and detailed brew analytics.
